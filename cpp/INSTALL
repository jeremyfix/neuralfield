Software/Hardware requirements
------------------------------

Supported operating systems
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The library has been developed and tested under Linux x86_64 with Ubuntu 16.04. Let me know if that works under other OS. :)


Dependencies
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Doxygen for building the documentation
- cmake  for compiling the library
- fftw3 for FFT based convolutions

Installation
------------

Manually
++++++++

Let's call ROOT_DIR the directory where the sources have been extracted so that you should already have the subdirectories ROOT_DIR/doc , ROOT_DIR/src , ROOT_DIR/examples ...

Compilation/Installation using cmake is done with :

- cd ROOT_DIR
- mkdir build
- cd build
- cmake .. -G"THE_GENERATOR" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr <-- type cmake to check the available generators on your platform
  e.g. on Linux :  cmake ..
- make
- make install

This will build :
- the library 
- the pkf-config file
- the binaries for the examples
- the documentation

and install everything in $PREFIX_INSTALL/lib, $PREFIX_INSTALL/lib/pkgconfig, $PREFIX_INSTALL/bin, $PREFIX_INSTALL/share/neuralfield as well as the headers in $PREFIX_INSTALL/include/neuralfield

Packages manager
++++++++++++++++

Packages for several distributions are provided.
