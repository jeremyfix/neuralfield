# Neuralfield

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jeremyfix/neuralfield.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jeremyfix/neuralfield)

This is a C++ library for efficiently simulating dynamic neural fields in 1D and 2D. It is based on defining several parametrized layers that can be recurrently connected.

This library is interfaced with popot which is used to optimize the parameters of the DNF.
